# BIO
For this assignment I created three html files, index, contact, and portfolio. After connecting them I found a bootstrap nav bar and modified
it so it stayed consistent with my pages. I added a contact template I found in boostrap to my contact page. For my portfolio page I only
included a box with the header portfolio. Lastly, I was able to make it so I could navigate from each link to the other. There are still
modifications that I need to make. I will use this as a lesson in time management.
